# Collaborative-app-using-socket.io-NODE-JS-

Programmed by: Parfait Kingwaya 


Overview: This web application is very simple program I created in order to play around with socket.io(a node module). When you start the server and go on to your http://localhost:3000/ you will
	  see a rectangle appear on a canvas with a random generated colour. You can move it around using arrow keys. The cool part about this application is that it uses socket.io in order to have multiple session of the same instance.
	  As you keep addning new web browser tab and connec to the http://localhost:3000/ you will see new rectangles added which interacts with the others as they touch.
	  This is just a fun program I used to learn more about collaborative application.

How to start the server:

In order to start the server properly you will have to enter the following command in order to install the dependencies of this Node.JS application which are Express (version: 4.16.2) and Request (version: 2.83.0):

>npm install

** Please note that you must be in the proper directory where the files are located.**

After the fiest command you can start the server by entering the following command:

	>node a2server.js

	Congrats the server is running on your localhost using the port 3000.
